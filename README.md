# üö¶ Automatic Smart Traffic Signal Control  

Automatic-Smart-Signal is an **AI-based traffic control system** that uses **YOLOv5/YOLOv7/YOLOv8** to detect ambulances, estimate traffic density, and dynamically switch signals in real time. It enhances traffic flow efficiency with adaptive logic, reduces delays, and ensures faster emergency response by dedicating signals for ambulances.

## Project Overview  
Urban traffic congestion is a growing problem, often leading to:  
- **Uncleared ambulance paths** delaying emergency care  
- **Long waiting times at signals** leading to inefficiency  
- **Unattended road accidents** increasing loss of life  

This project presents an **AI-powered Smart Traffic Signal Control System** that optimizes traffic management using **computer vision, IoT, and machine learning**. The system adapts signal timings based on real-time traffic data and prioritizes emergency vehicles by introducing a **dedicated emergency signal**.

## Objectives  
- Enable **easy movement of ambulances** through major signals.  
- **Reduce loss of life** due to unattended accidents.  
- **Minimize waiting times** at traffic signals using adaptive control.

##  Key Features  
-  **Dynamic Signal Timing** ‚Äì Adjusts lights based on real-time density.  
-  **Emergency Vehicle Priority** ‚Äì Detects ambulances via **YOLOv8**, siren detection, and GPS signals.  
-  **Dedicated Emergency Signal (Novelty)** ‚Äì A **blue light** blinks to alert the public until the ambulance clears the junction.  
-  **Traffic Density Estimation** ‚Äì Uses **YOLOv7** for fast, accurate density analysis.  
-  **Accident Detection & Alerts** ‚Äì Detects accident severity (YOLOv7) and notifies via mobile app.  
-  **IoT + Cloud Integration** ‚Äì Collects siren frequency, GPS, and camera inputs for decision-making.  
-  **Modular Workflow** ‚Äì Separate scripts for training, validation, and prediction.  
-  **Interactive Notebook** ‚Äì Hands-on demo of the pipeline.
